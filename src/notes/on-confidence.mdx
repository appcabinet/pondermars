An old piece I should have released a long time ago.
</CenterQuote>

I have made a more serious conversion to Christianity in these past two months. Although I will save my journey away from Buddhism for another time, I’d like to shed some light on this transition as it forms the backbone of my argument for this piece.

2024 was a tumultuous year for Canadians. Between the momentous U.S. elections, the resignation of our Prime Minister, and frightening global tensions on the rise, many of us sat on the edge of our seats as we watched the world change before our very eyes. Many of us remain concerned – fewer of us are ever optimistic.

However much I may meditate, I am not impervious to these issues. For much of 2024, I neglected my meditation practice and spiritual work in favour of more “worldly” affairs. I began to read more about history, capitalism, politics, and everything in between. If I could only understand how the world worked could I liberate myself from all the suffering on the planet.

This was unfortunately (and obviously) not true, and additionally met with negative outcomes. When I drifted my attention away from myself and towards the world I found myself embittered. I failed to attend to my home and my relationships. I stopped working out. I stopped meditating. Without the requisite wisdom to handle the world's issues in moderation, a sickening spiritual malaise began to take place. If I was truly concerned with making the world a better place, would letting my personal life fall apart for its sake be the right thing to do?

During my studies in Germany, I happened to come across the German term for the word "self-confidence": __Selbstvertrauen__. This struck me immediately because the anatomy of the word is quite apparent. Selbst, meaning "self," and vertrauen, meaning "trust." Confidence in German is therefore, to trust in oneself.

We can take this one step further. The verb __vertrauen__ comes from the Old High German __firtrūēn__, which shares roots with the English word "true." The prefix __ver-__ in German often indicates a completeness or intensification of the action—it transforms the basic concept of trust into a more comprehensive form of confidence or reliance. When combined with __selbst__ (self) to form __Selbstvertrauen__, it creates a particularly powerful concept that goes beyond simple self-trust. For Germans, to have __Selbstvertrauen__ means **to have complete trust in one's own abilities, judgment, and worth.**

When we talk about confidence in this way, we are faced with quite a difficult question: how does one go about completely trusting in oneself in their day-to-day life? Is that even possible?

# Trusting Oneself

In order to understand what trusting oneself means, we must first understand what trust is. Looking at the American Heritage dictionary definition, we run into an issue:

<NoteImage src={"https://lhfsdw7dl5.ucarecd.net/6b3abea0-3182-42df-bc4f-e795290d4cb4/confidencedefinition.png"} alt="Confidence Definition" quality="max">
Definition of confidence, re: American Heritage Dictionary
</NoteImage>

To trust is to have confidence in something. Yet, if self-confidence is trusting in oneself, and self-trust means having confidence in oneself, we run into a recursive definition! How can we begin untangling this?

<Aside>
This unfortunately leads to the problem of induction — a fundamental reason why trying to accumulate evidence about ourselves is fundamentally flawed. We can spend years cultivating a sense of self, only for one experience to shatter it. I will nonetheless save this for another article.
</Aside>

As I see it, trust is ultimately an empirical process. Built on repeated experience and evidence, we extend trust based on a pattern underlying reliability or demonstrated consistency. I trust the chair I am sitting on to hold my weight. My trust in this chair comes from previous experiences sitting in chairs, and some experience with this particular chair. If at some point the chair collapses and I fall, not only is my trust in the chair broken; the metaphorical "ground" my trust was built on collapses as well.

Going back to self-confidence, we can begin re-framing self-trust as a method of accumulating evidence about ourselves. Once we have enough evidence to assert who we are, we either become confident, or begin lacking confidence if we don't act in accordance with our values and ideals. Alex Hormozi nails the definition of self-confidence on the head:

>You don't become confident by shouting affirmations in the mirror, but by having a stack of undeniable proof that you are who you say you are.

# Overcoming Self-Doubt / Finding Your Standing In The World

__Selbstvertrauen__ then, is an assertion of who we are and what we are capable of, predicated on evidence accumulated from previous experiences.
 
An apt definition. But there's an issue here: what if we don't have the experience, or "stacks of undeniable proof" to make us confident in ourselves in the first place? Are we destined to lack self-belief until we find our standing in the world?

The central answer to this question in my opinion, comes down to integrity. Namely, that __confidence blossoms naturally when we decide to lead lives of high integrity.__ Put even more succinctly:

<CenterQuote>
True confidence is a function of integrity.
</CenterQuote>

Humans that lead high integrity lives blossom in the face of adversity. These sorts of people are concerned with bringing about the highest possible Good at any given moment (or at least, not making things worse). When you meet such a person, they are often warm, strong, and extremely present — which form the foundations of charisma, as outlined in The Charisma Myth:

>“Conveying visionary charisma requires the ability to project complete conviction and confidence in a cause. In this way, visionary charisma is based on power. However, it is also based on warmth. Visionary charismatics aren’t necessarily warm people, but they do feel strongly, even passionately, about their vision. And to be truly charismatic, their vision must include a certain amount of nobility and altruism. One reporter described Steve Jobs as being “driven by a nearly messianic zeal.… Jobs doesn’t sell computers. He sells the promise of a better world.”
