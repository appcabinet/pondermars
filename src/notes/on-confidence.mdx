An old piece I should have released a long time ago.
</CenterQuote>

I have made a more serious conversion to Christianity in these past two months. Although I will save my journey away from Buddhism for another time, I’d like to shed some light on this transition as it forms the backbone of my argument for this piece.

2024 was a tumultuous year for Canadians. Between the momentous U.S. elections, the resignation of our Prime Minister, and frightening global tensions on the rise, many of us sat on the edge of our seats as we watched the world change before our very eyes. Many of us remain concerned – fewer of us are ever optimistic.

However much I may meditate, I am not impervious to these issues. For much of 2024, I neglected my meditation practice and spiritual work in favour of more “worldly” affairs. I began to read more about history, capitalism, politics, and everything in between. If I could only understand how the world worked could I liberate myself from all the suffering on the planet.

This was unfortunately (and obviously) not true, and additionally met with negative outcomes. When I drifted my attention away from myself and towards the world I found myself embittered. I failed to attend to my home and my relationships. I stopped working out. I stopped meditating. Without the requisite wisdom to handle the world's issues in moderation, a sickening spiritual malaise began to take place. If I was truly concerned with making the world a better place, would letting my personal life fall apart for its sake be the right thing to do?

During my studies in Germany, I happened to come across the German term for the word "self-confidence": _Selbstvertrauen_. This struck me immediately because the anatomy of the word is quite apparent. Selbst, meaning "self," and vertrauen, meaning "trust." Confidence in German is therefore, to trust in oneself.

We can take this one step further. The verb _vertrauen_ comes from the Old High German _firtrūēn_, which shares roots with the English word "true." The prefix _ver-_ in German often indicates a completeness or intensification of the action—it transforms the basic concept of trust into a more comprehensive form of confidence. When combined with _selbst_ (self) to form _Selbstvertrauen_, it creates a particularly powerful concept that goes beyond simple self-trust. For Germans, to have _Selbstvertrauen_ means **to have complete trust in one's own abilities, judgment, and worth.**

When we talk about confidence in this way, we are faced with quite a difficult question: how does one go about completely trusting in oneself in their day-to-day life? Is that even possible?

# Trusting Oneself

In order to understand what trusting oneself means, we must first understand what trust is. Looking at the American Heritage dictionary definition, we run into an issue:

<NoteImage src={"https://lhfsdw7dl5.ucarecd.net/6b3abea0-3182-42df-bc4f-e795290d4cb4/confidencedefinition.png"} alt="Confidence Definition" quality="max">
Definition of confidence, re: American Heritage Dictionary
</NoteImage>

To trust is to have confidence in something. Yet, if self-confidence is trusting in oneself, and self-trust means having confidence in oneself, we run into a recursive definition! How can we begin untangling this?

<Aside>
This unfortunately leads to the problem of induction — a fundamental reason why trying to accumulate evidence about ourselves is a fundamentally flawed approach. We can spend years cultivating a sense of self, only for one experience to shatter it completely. I will nonetheless save this argument for another article.
</Aside>

As I see it, trust is ultimately an empirical process. Built on repeated experience and evidence, we extend trust based on a pattern underlying reliability or demonstrated consistency. I trust the chair I am sitting on to hold my weight. My trust in this chair comes from previous experiences sitting in chairs, and some experience with this particular chair. If at some point the chair collapses and I fall, not only is my trust in the chair broken; the metaphorical “ground” my trust was built on collapses as well.

Going back to self-confidence, we can begin re-framing self-trust as a method of accumulating evidence about ourselves. Once we have enough evidence to assert who we are, we either become confident, or begin lacking confidence if we don't act in accordance with our values and ideals. Alex Hormozi nails the definition of self-confidence on the head:

>You don't become confident by shouting affirmations in the mirror, but by having a stack of undeniable proof that you are who you say you are.

# Finding Your Standing

_Selbstvertrauen_ then, is an assertion of who we are and what we are capable of, predicated on evidence accumulated from previous experiences.
 
An apt definition. But there's an issue here: what if we don't have the experience, or "stacks of undeniable proof" to make us confident in ourselves in the first place? Are we destined to lack self-belief until we find our standing in the world? And what about children? Should children lack confidence until they prove themselves useful to society?

The central answer to this question in my opinion, comes down to integrity. Namely, that _confidence blossoms naturally when we decide to lead lives of high integrity._ Put even more succinctly:

<CenterQuote>
True confidence is a function of integrity.

Coincidentally, this forms the foundation of charisma as outlined in the _Charisma Myth_ by Olivia Fox Cobane.
</Aside>

High integrity individuals inadvertently bring about a tremendous Good in the world. Whenever you meet such a person, they are often warm, powerful, and very present in their interactions with you. This is not a facade — just integrity shining through. My two favourite anime characters of all time, Gon (Hunter x Hunter) and Luffy (One Piece) exhibit these traits. They have no qualms putting their lives on the line when they believe their cause is just. Despite being characters with incredible goals, they are not willing to compromise when it comes to their friendships, or helping out a stranger in need.

# Confidence as Righteousness

It is my belief that through the application of Christian principles (and religious principles in general), individuals are able to overcome themselves and move beyond feelings of self-doubt through a form of religious ego-death. Instead of being incessantly preoccupied by your worldly limitations, Christianity asks you to aim above and beyond yourself (indeed, beyond the world) in the spirit of bringing about the highest possible Good for humanity. By removing yourself from the equation, taking right action becomes easier because _it's no longer about you._

Christianity therefore, propels forward action by asking that you overcome yourself in service of some higher Good. This is why my transition to Christianity was deeply pivotal — once I stopped worrying about myself and whether I was up to the task, I simply picked myself and tackled the challenge in front of me for no other reason than it was the right thing to do.

<CenterQuote>
The fullness of your self-trust emerges from your ability to take Right action.
</CenterQuote>

From an outside perspective, the forthrightness of your actions will spell confidence. Yet from the inside, the core propelling force is not something so worldly – it is in fact, something far greater. The intensity and zeal of your actions will astound those around you, as you are committed to the most noble purpose of all. In so doing, confidence and self-doubt will exist as afterthoughts, as mere mirages of your divine pursuit of the ultimate ideal.

# I Am Asking You to Be a Good Person

At the end of the day, the question of right action is a deeply personal affair, and something no person can hold you completely accountable to. You may strive to be a good person, but engage in all manner of wicked deeds and thoughts during the night. Only when your room is tidy, you've attended to your relationships wholeheartedly, can you confront the world with your shoulders back and your head held high. 

>“Morality then, seems to be concerned with three things. Firstly, fair play and harmony between individuals. Secondly, with what might be called tidying up or harmonizing the things inside each individual. Thirdly, with the general purpose of human life as whole: what man was made for, what course the whole fleet ought to be on: what tune the conductor of the band wants to play.” — C. S. Lewis, _Mere Christianity_

Morality is an [infinite game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Infinite_Game) that involves constant maintenance and course correction. When we live in harmony with ourselves, others, and the greater good of humanity, we can move forward with courage to speak up for what we believe in.
